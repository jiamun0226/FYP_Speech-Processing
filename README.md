# FYP_Speech-Processing
2022/2023 FYP Robotic Speech Processing Source Code

To enhance on the RNN text classification model namely "student_model":
  1. Download "Student_Staff Classification.ipynb" and "student_staff.csv".
  2. Google Colab is good enough to train the model as the dataset is very small.
  3. "student_staff.csv" is the current dataset I used to train the model, feel free to enlarge/change the dataset to train a new model.
  4. To run the speech processing module with new model, just the old "student_model" to a new "student_model" will do.
  
If you are using JUNO robot with serial number MA020015, please run these command to run the program:
  1. In first terminal, run:
  $ roscore
